       <p> 
           This website is about the journey of me Ethan and <br>
           how I traverse throught this CSC Course here at uri. <br>
           In this course we will be learning some html and javascript <br>
           in which I have litle to none experince <br>
           with.I took some classes at the Public Libaray a while <br>
           ago and were we coding with the same languages <br>
           but it never really stuck so I forgot most of it. <br>
           In this website I am planning on making buttons to go <br>
           to pages were I talk more about myself and how my projects. <br>
           Hopefully by the end of this class I will <br>
           have the website fully functioning with the things <br>
           I want showing off what I learned in this class. <br>
