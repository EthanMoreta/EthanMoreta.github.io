               This is a quick description for the game, as you can see in the title this program is a game about mario kart. <br>
               Some quick instructions on how to play the game is by firstly pressing start, you will then be greeted with a character selection screen <br>
               here you have four options. You can choose either Mario, Luigi, Ryan, or Ethan and whichever you pick will the color of the racer car you will <br>
               drive when playing the game. After you pick the character you will have to pick a track, there are also four options there Square, Traingle, Circle, <br>
               Ryan, Circuit. All these tracks are pretty simple (some harder than others) but the way you play is by using the arrow keys, the up arrow makes you go <br>
               straight and down makes you go backwards, the right arrow makes you turn right the same with the left arrow. After you go around the lab 3 times it gives <br>
               you your time and see how fast you went, you can keep going and see who gets the fastest time on each track. Thats pretty much all there is to my game Enjoy! <br>
