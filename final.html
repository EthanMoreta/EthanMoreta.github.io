               This is a quick description for the game, as you can see in the title this program is a game about mario kart. <br>
               Some quick instructions on how to play the game is by firstly pressing start, you will then be greeted with a <br>
               character selection screen here you have four options. You can choose either Mario, Luigi, Ryan, or Ethan and <br>
               whichever you pick will the color of the racer car you will drive when playing the game. After you pick the <br>
               character you will have to pick a track, there are also four options there Square, Traingle, Circle, Ryan, Circuit. <br>
               All these tracks are pretty simple (some harder than others) but the way you play is by using the arrow keys, the <br>
               up arrow makes you go straight and down makes you go backwards, the right arrow makes you turn right the same <br>
               with the left arrow. After you go around the lab 3 times it gives you your time and see how fast you went, you <br>
               can keep going and see who gets the fastest time on each track. Thats pretty much all there is to my game Enjoy! <br>
