           My name is Ethan Moreta. This web site is my porfolio of programs that I have written for the CSC106 Computer 
           Programming Course at the <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">the University of Rhode Island. I wrote this web page itself using the HTML programming
           language. The About me link has a page about me and the javascripts link has projects I will be doing in the future.
